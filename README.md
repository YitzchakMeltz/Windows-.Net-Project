<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
My partner and I developed a management system application using C#, WPF, and the .NET Framework for our college project at JCT. The application focuses on tracking drones, packages, customers, and charging stations. It follows a layered architecture for scalability and code modularity. Additionally, we incorporated a modular delivery simulation component to stimulate the system being used. The application provides a user-friendly interface and streamlines the management process for efficient tracking and monitoring of various entities.

We spent a lot of time trying to make this program as good as it possibly can be all while
following the rules and guidelines given to us by our college. A lot of effort was put into
having clean and precise code and a very smooth and friendly user experience.
We hope you enjoy it!

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Clone our repository to your computer and open it using Visual Studio. Build and run **PL**.
*Note: Check that you have .Net installed on your computer*

### Notes

After downloading the repository you may notice that the manager’s access is restricted by a
password. The default manager password is 0000. It is recommended to change this as
soon as possible to a more secure password. When trying to change the password you will
need to choose a password that has at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, a
number and a special character.
For your convenience, customers that are already in the system as default data do not have
a password. All customers that are added to the system will need to have a password.
